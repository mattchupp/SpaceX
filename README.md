# SpaceX Wiki

This is somewhat of a wiki/informational page for spacex based on the [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API). Built because I think Space is cool and so I can track future/past launches. 

[Check it out](https://spacex.mthyu.com)

Hosted for free on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
